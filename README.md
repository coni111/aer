# A modern weather app made in Flutter 💙🌅
⛱A simple school project, ***but actually more...*** 

#### I have to create a Flutter weather application which can forecast the weather (and I also want to add maps support as well).🌦 

> The application is capable to show weather informations all around hungary, in every single region. ✅

The logo, icons, and designs all of them are made by me (Coni), so please do not steal it, thanks ❤ (but if you're planning so, please reach out to me)
